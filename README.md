# Code Climate Test Reporter

Code Climate's test reporter is a binary that works in coordination with codeclimate.com to report test coverage data. Once you've set up test coverage reporting you can:
* view test coverage reports for each file alongside quality metrics like complexity, duplication, and churn,
* toggle between viewing code issues and test coverage line-by-line in the same source listings,
* block PRs from being merged if they don't meet your team's standards for test coverage percentage.

Code Climate accepts test coverage data from virtually any location, including locally run tests or your continuous integration (CI) service, and supports a variety of programming languages and test coverage formats, including Ruby, JavaScript, Go, Python, PHP, Java, and more.

For installation instructions, check out our docs on [Configuring Test Coverage](https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/configuring-test-coverage) and [Test Coverage Troubleshooting Tips](https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/test-coverage-troubleshooting-tips).
